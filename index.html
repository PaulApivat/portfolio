							<h3><em>Learning</em></h3>
							<h4>Product Management</h4>
							<p>I&#8217;m excited to be immersed in product management where I will help shape the product vision and scope. I&#8217;ll build a product road map and manage the entire lifecycle from start to finish. Along the way, my partner and I will oversee the entire process from user experience and interaction through testing and implementation. While I&#8217;m hoping to polish my design and technical skills, I&#8217;m excited to be working directly with designers, developers and education specialist.</p>

							<h4>Entrepreneurship</h4>
							<p>In helping launch a business unit responsible for product innovation, i&#8217;m looking to sharpen various entrepreneurial <a href="http://learn.onemonth.com/resources-for-the-full-stack-entrepreneur" rel="external" title="The Full Stack Entrepreneur">skills</a>. Everything from product management to edtech to organizational management, I&#8217;ll be documenting my learning <a href="#" rel="external" title="Blog">here</a> and <a href="#" rel="external" title="Medium">here.</a></p>

							<h4>Technical Skills</h4>
							<p>I&#8217;m honing my skills in <acronym title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</acronym>/<acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>, and Javascript by building mini-websites <a href="http://paulapivat.github.io/" ref="external" title="Paul Apivat">here</a>.</p>

							<h3><em>Work</em></h3>
							<h4>English Confidence</h4>
							<p>We are designing an English-learning product for Thai middle schoolers (grade 7-9) that will result in confident language usage and adoption. Our prototypes, informed by research and human-centered design, will be tested with students and teachers alike. Our goal is <strong>product-market fit</strong> by November 2017. And <strong>&#8220;at scale&#8221;</strong> by 2018.</p>

							<h4>Learn-X Innovation Unit</h4>
							<p>My partner and I will be launching and growing Learn-X. We will develop a <em>repeatable, smart process </em> for developing, prototyping and commercializing education products. This will include developing and documenting an innovation process for <a href="http://www.learneducation.co.th" rel="external" title="Learn Education">Learn Education</a>, our parent company, but also structuring the organization for innovation. Moreover, we will be building a team at Learn-X to position the unit for multiple innovations in the coming years. Our goal is to have a documented process than can onboard new team members by 2017.</p>

							<h4>@Scale</h4>
							<p>Ultimately, we want our educational innovations to reach a critical mass of 1,500 schools in Thailand. We will learn from LearnEd&#8217;s experience scaling math and science products. I look forward to generating new and fresh insights into scaling our English-language products.</p>

								<p>Just a few kind words from some of the great people I have had the pleasure of helping.</p>
											<blockquote>
												<p>&#8220;Paul's key strength is he knows how to bring the best out of you while guiding you through the admission application process. He asks the right questions to help you unlock your potential step by step: from a blank paper to a complete Statement of Purpose. Moreover, he can also help prepare you for the interview session as well.</p> 

												<p>I recommended him to several students who applied to top schools and universities in the U.S. All of them were satisfied with his coaching sessions, and of course, they were all admitted into their prospective institutions. Indeed I am one of his success cases and I have been successfully admitted into the doctoral program at Columbia University. 

												Thank you so much, Paul. &#8221;</p>

												<p>&#8220;I really have to thank Paul so much for his great help on my doctoral application. He is truly knowledgable and gave me constant, constructive feedback on my Statement of Purpose. He knows exactly what the admission committee are looking for and is able to bring my true potential to standout among all applicants. Paul gave me an analysis of my writing in depth. He identified the strengths and the points of improvement on my application. His advice has enhanced my Statement of Purpose immensely.</p> <p>Paul, thanks again for your help.&#8221;</p>

											<blockquote>
											<p>&#8220;I had Paul helped me revise my SOP for my master's degree application and his constructive comments became very helpful. His reviews ranged from broad concepts of my SOP to details of sentence structures. Those comments helped me reflect back on my message, and in the end, greatly enhance the content of which I tried to convey.</p>

											<p>For every written piece, especially for non-native speakers like me, it's very important to have peer reviews along the way to give comments with fresh perspectives. I would recommend Paul to anyone who's in the process of writing their SOP's or other pieces.&#8221;</p>
